# Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Cancer Cases in Canada (1992-2022)

## Overview
This project automates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for analyzing **primary cancer cases in Canada (1992-2022)**.  
It follows a **modular architecture** that supports **data ingestion, transformation, and statistical analysis** while ensuring **reproducibility**.

### **Key Features**
- **Automated EDA Execution** using Python scripts.
- **Modular Framework** with separate components for **data ingestion, transformation, and statistical analysis**.
- **Factory Design Pattern** for dynamically loading data from multiple sources (**CSV, JSON, SQL**).
- **Automated Jupyter Notebook Execution** using `nbconvert` for reproducibility.
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualization** to uncover trends in **cancer incidence rates** across Canada.
